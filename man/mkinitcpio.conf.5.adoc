= mkinitcpio.conf(5)

== Name

mkinitcpio.conf - mkinitcpio configuration file

== Synopsis

_/etc/mkinitcpio.conf_

== Description

mkinitcpio will attempt to read from a configuration file each time it is
invoked, _/etc/mkinitcpio.conf_ by default. This file defines several variables
which describe the contents of the image to be generated.

== Variables

*MODULES*::
    Defines an array of additional modules which should be added to the image.
    Dependencies (including other modules and necessary firmware), will also be
    added to the image. At runtime, the modules in this array which were
    successfully added to the image will be explicitly loaded.

*FILES*::
    Defines an array of additional files which should be added to the image.
    Files are added as is, and parent directories will be added if needed. Files
    specified in this variable will override previously added files of the same
    path.

*BINARIES*::
    Defines an array of additional binaries which should be added to the
    image. These are assumed to be dynamic ELF binaries, and necessary shared
    library dependencies will automatically be added. However, it is not
    considered an error to specify a non-ELF binary in this variable. Parent
    directories will be added if needed. Files specified in this variable will
    override previously added files of the same path.

*HOOKS*::
    Defines an array of hooks which will be run during the build process.
    Order is important, as it defines the order in which hooks will be run
    during bootup. Use mkinitcpio's *-L* flag to list all available hooks,
    and the *-H* flag to display the help text for a specific hook.

*COMPRESSION*::
    Defines a program to filter the generated image through. The kernel
    understands the compression formats yielded by the *zstd*(1), *gzip*(1),
    *bzip2*(1), *lz4*(1), *lzop*(1), *lzma*(1), and *xz*(1) compressors. If
    unspecified, this setting defaults to _zstd_ compression. In order to create
    an uncompressed image, define this variable as _cat_.
     +
    It is not hard to realize that a filter such as a _tac_ or _rev_ will cause
    *mkinitcpio* to report success but generate a useless image. Similarly,
    using a compression program not listed above may generate an equally useless
    image, despite being "valid".

*COMPRESSION_OPTIONS*::
    Defines an array of additional options to be passed to the compression
    program. This option is generally not used. It can be potentially dangerous
    and may cause invalid images to be generated without any sign of an error.

*MODULES_DECOMPRESS*::
    Switch (_yes_/_no_) to decide wether kernel modules should be compressed or
    uncompressed during initramfs creation. Enabled by default for faster bootup
    and smaller initramfs size. Disable it to reduce RAM usage in early
    userspace.
